# Iris Flower Classification

During my Data Science internship at InternPedia, I had the opportunity to work on a fascinating project centered around the classification of iris flowers using machine learning techniques. This classic dataset provided the perfect platform to sharpen my skills in data analysis and model building.

**Project Highlights:**

Objective: Develop a predictive model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, based on their physical characteristics.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Techniques: Data visualization, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

**What I Learned:**

The critical role of data visualization in understanding feature distributions and relationships.

How to implement and compare different classification algorithms to determine the best fit for the dataset.

The importance of cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning in optimizing model performance.

**Outcome:**

Successfully built a classification model with an accuracy of [Your Accuracy Score]%. This project reinforced my understanding of the classification process and provided hands-on experience with essential machine learning concepts.

**Gratitude:**

I’m incredibly thankful to the InternPedia team for their guidance and support. This project has been instrumental in advancing my data science journey, and I’m excited to take on more challenges in the future!
